<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a registered nurse turned entrepreneur and self-taught web developer.</p>

<p>I have always loved writing and building things which is why 
  I left nursing for more creative pursuits. In 2022, I started 
  to dabble in freelance digital marketing, social media 
  management, and video and image-based content creation.</p>

<p>When I'm not working on web development or marketing projects, 
  you can find me filming videos for my (relatively new) 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LifeWithYen">Youtube channel</a>, reviewing <a href="https://www.sayweee.com/en/account/profile/10900338">food products</a>, or walking 
  my elderly dog at the nearby nature trails. </p>
  
  <p>Let's connect and see how we can collaborate!</p>
